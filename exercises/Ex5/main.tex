\section{Long-Range Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[a)]
    since we can use $P_{D}(w_1,w_2)= P(w_1\cap w_2)$ for independend words and further $P(w_1\cap w_2) = P(w_1)*P(w_2)$ the correlation should be 1 for independend words.
    \item[d)]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/correlation.png}
    The plot shows that the less context 2 words have the lower the correlation is, down to about 1. Further you can observe that a low correlation leads to fewer differences between the values. On the other side the words with high dependency like he and his have a lot of fluctuations.
    \item[e)]

    same observations as in d.
